// When you are absolutely concerned with performance, or need perfect
// precision on the uploaded/downloaded values, you can pass an Uint32Array
// to the get and set functions. That way, each value is accessed as a vec4
// on the shader, with each component ranging from 0 to 255. This avoids
// overhead from both Float packing and buffer allocation on the get/set ops.
// Be warned the get function will **modify the original buffer**!
